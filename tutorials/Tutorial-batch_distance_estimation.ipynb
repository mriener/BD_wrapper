For example, the coordinates of `G018.89-00.51` coincided with a clump from the catalogue of [Urquhart et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.473.1059U/abstract) abbreviated as `U+18`. This clump is located at the near kinematic distance, which is why `p_far` was reduced to a value of `0.12`, which weights the kinematic distance solutions so as to favour the near distance. For the `G053.59+00.04` and `G049.49-00.41` clouds no literature sources could be associated (`KDA_ref=--`), which means their `p_far` value stayed at the neutral position of `0.5`, thus neither favoring the near or far kinematic distance solution.\n",

[Roman-Duval et al. 2009](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...699.1153R/abstract) also used a different rotation curve model and a different distance to the Galactic center, which both account for small variations in the estimated distances."
